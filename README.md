## Introduction
Hermes is a Node.JS application that ingests data, munges it, and evaluates the munged data against configurable conditions. When conditions are met anouncements can be set to notify users of the event. Kafka is used to distribute the work of munging the data and create transform streams. Redis is used as the backing store for the task queue system responsibe for periodically fetching external data using the Bull task system and publishing the data to Kafka. Munged data is stored in MongoDB with added classifiers. In the future Elastic Search usage may be added if full text search over captured data is needed/desired.
